# AUTO-WATER-DISPENSER-2.

Description

This project is based on an infrared (IR) sensor, which detects the presence of hands and consequently activates the motor pump to dispense water. The circuit is economical, reliable, and can be easily constructed, as explained later below 

I am  working on this simple DIY project to help students/staffs use in the schools for handwashing in the refugee settlements

# Challenges

The IR proximity sensor detects external radiotions/light on exposer to sun heat/light.

Future Improvements

Further development of the project - proper casing and recargeble component 

Vision Statement Providing refugee schools with non touchable (Automatic) locally made water dispenser.
