# AUTO-WATER-DISPENSER-2.

* Description

This project is based on an infrared (IR) sensor, which detects the presence of hands and consequently activates the motor pump to dispense water. The circuit is economical, reliable, and can be easily constructed, as explained later below 

I am  working on this simple DIY project to help students/staffs use in the schools for handwashing in the refugee settlements

 # What Transpired?

Following https://wikifactory.com/+criticalmaking/stories/automatic-h20-dispenser-in-rhino-camp-refugee-settlement ,i want to promote the culture of waste recycling (E-waste and plastic waste ) in the local communities.

 # Why Automatic water Dispenser?

When washing hands using a conventional/traditional tap, you must touch it with your dirty hands to turn it onâ€”leaving behind germs, bacteria and viruses Automatic taps controlled by a sensor are therefore a good alternative for making hand washing more hygienic, especially in schools where students live

 # Challenges

The IR proximity sensor detects external radiotions/light on exposer to sun heat/light.

*Future Improvements*

Further development of the project - proper casing and recargeble component 

*Vision Statement Providing refugee schools with non touchable (Automatic) locally made water dispenser*
